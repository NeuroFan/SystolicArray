# Systolic_Array_ABFT
SPICE and Behavioral simulation of systolic array equipped with ABFT 



The following is an example screen shot of DUT. The output is not messy as it is spice simulation results. 
The simulation for finding optimum voltage-frequency requires sweeping from full-scall Vdd down to threshold voltage, however we do not need to sweep
frequency (and hence save a huge simulation time) as the results for 1 slow enough clock period determinds the maximum operating frequency.
